# MusicPTN

MusicPTN is an interactive web application designed to help adult beginners with no prior music background learn the seven basic musical notes (C–B) by connecting pitch to notation through short, guided exercises.

The project was built as a personal exploration of software engineering principles, UI/UX design, and web-based audio synthesis.

## Live Demo

## Tech Stack
- React
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Web Audio API
- SVG
- Figma (design and prototyping)

## Features
- Guided exercises focused on pitch-to-notation recognition
- Visual learning path with progress indicators
- Immediate feedback on user input
- SVG-based musical staff and note components that scale responsively
- Audio synthesis of musical pitches using fundamental frequencies and overtones

## Design & Engineering Approach
- Defined an MVP using user stories, functional requirements, and quality attributes
- Prioritized efficiency of use (10–15 minute exercises), memorability, and modifiability
- Created wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes in Figma, iterating based on feedback
- Structured the codebase with reusable React components and strongly typed data models

## Getting Started
To run the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/musicptn.git
